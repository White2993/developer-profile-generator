# developer-profile-generator

I always seem to get a late start on these things recently.

I did decide to do something a bit challenging and very out of my wheelhouse though.

I used PDFkit to automatically create the pdf without the use of HTML.
Now, I don't know if you've ever used PDFkit but I hate it.
The documentation was incredibly hard to parse but maybe that's just me.
Also with 240,000 some odd downloads a week you think you'd be able to find more help threads on the google.

But I digress, even with it's shortcomings I am very satisfied being able to complete most of it with something so difficult to me.

Est time to completion: 15ish hours
